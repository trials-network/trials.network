# Tools to Help with International Co-operation of Clinical Trials

At the moment each country/institution is performing clinical trials independently, sharing the results at the end of the trials. This is a relatively slow and inefficient process. 

Results are reinforced by serially replicating the trials elsewhere. 

Clinical trials can be particularly difficult in Covid-19 cases since most patient recover spontaneously regardless of cure. The chance of false positives is high, particularly for antivirals that could help in earlier stages. This requires larger tests that can be more easily achieved via co-ordination.

In addition several different treatments have to be tested in parallel, if each one is performed vs a control set, this creates futher inefficiencies. 

A blockchain stack could improve co-operation at international level and across institutions thus speeding up aggregation of results and improving reliability and security.

A user friendly UI can also help overburdened personnel do the data entry faster and with fewer errors.

# Implementation


## Input forms (prelimminary)

As a consideration inputing should be as fast as possible, with as little typing as possible, work well on mobile/tablet/desktop. Ideally Android/iOS/browser.

### Form for testing institution details
* Institution Name
* Address
* Person(s) Responsible

### Form for patient characteristics
* SiteSpecific Patient-ID (anonymous)
* Sex
* DoB
* Etnicity
* Pre-existing conditions
* Pre-existing medications
* Allergies
* CovidSymptoms StartDate
* Hospitzlization Date

### Form for daily evolution 
* DateTime / Temperature
* DateTime / Oxygen level
* DateTime / BP
* DateTime / ?
* Covid19 Tests: DateTime / test-type / result
* Covid19 Staging: DateTime / Staging
* Covid19 Symptoms: DateTiem / Symptom
* Non-Covid19 Symptoms: DateTime / Symptom
* MedicalTreatement: DateTime / Treatment / dose
* Non-MedicalTreatement: DateTime / Treatment (EG oxygen/ventilation/...)

## Editor Application
* API + Web + Mobile App
* Authentication/Authorization for write access, possibly per site
* Entry forms

## Data Browser and Analytics
* API + Web
* Authentication/Authorization for read access, possibly per site
* Filter functionality:
	* Extract all individual records
	* Aggregation functionality:
		* Aggregate across relevant metrics via dashboards
		* Extract aggregated data

## Authorization (preliminary)

### Write Side

* Main responsible person per each site can assign editors/readers and edit site form
* Editors can fill patient forms

## Read Side

* All editors can access all records of their own site
* WHO can permission each site to see each other data
* WHO can permission other institutions to access data

# Logical Architecture
(this section is a stub)

![image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Clinical_Trial_blockchain_logical_Architecture.png/800px-Clinical_Trial_blockchain_logical_Architecture.png)

## Institution / Site
It is the hospital, Cro, organisation in general, conducting the Clinical Trial
## WHO Competent Authority
it is the reference organisation on WHO side, gathering information from all the local Institutions / Sites
## Users
### Ctrial Adm
it's the personnel in charge of setting up the Clinical Trial, in conformance to the essential Ctrial Documents 
### Ctrial Ops
It's the presonnel in charge of updating Ctrial info, possibly on daily basis. info includes Patient data, and disease daily evolution parameters
## Web App
it's the standard web application allowing users to creat and edit Ctrial information
the web app shall allow the user to interact seamlessly with the blockchain, thanks to the back end integration with the institution / site associated Wallet.

## Blockchain
### Blockchain Type
It's suggested, for the initial PoC phase, to set up a Proo-of-authority Blockchain (4 validator nodes), based on CosmosSDK/Tendermint frameworks

### Wallet
it's a standard Cosmos HD Wallet, including the account management developed by Commercio network project,based on Decentralised Identifier and COM DID Method

### Supported Transactions
An initial set of supported transactions includes:
#### SetTrial
create a record for the Ctrial, identified with the Institution / Site DID as Controller, and its DID as subject.
the record includes all the referrals to the Ctrial sections, namely:
- Investigator's brochure
- Clinical Study protocol
- Protocol Amendment (optional)
- Informed Consents (optional)
- Study Progress Report (optional)
- Case Report Form (optional)
All the referred documents are identified via DID fragment (for instance: <Ctrial DID>#iBrochure) and the respective Decentralised Storage URI.
	
#### UpdateTrial
Update an existing CTrial record.
Can update any of the CTrial sections

#### Sharetrial
Share Trial with other subjects (DID), sharing the cryptographic material to access data or other access rights.

### Decentralised Storage
permanetly stores each version/snapshot of all the data submitted for a Ctrial record.
URIs are referred in Ctrial record, at each completed section

### CTrial Schema
TBC
